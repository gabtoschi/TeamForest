# Team Forest

**Team Forest** was my first game and probably my first project as a programmer. I designed and coded it in Delphi/Object Pascal (the only programming language that I knew at the time) in 2012 as a science fair project during high school. The code is probably really bad, but the game works for some minutes until the really unbalanced design shines. 

The idea was create a game to conscientize people that doing bad things with forests is bad, I think. There isn't documentation or something like that, I rushed all the development in the weekend before the fair (it was my first game jam, after all). It is only avaliable in Brazilian Portuguese for Windows and I don't have any plans to translate or fix the bugs in the code.

I'm just uploading this legacy version to GitHub for my own nostalgia and, if I became a famous game designer someday, show that everyone started with a bugged, really bad game (and probably made another 20 of them) before make something good.

# Credits

I'm trusting my 14-years-old self here, but besides me doing the code and game design, I have to thanks more people for this:

- Ana Laura Bortoloto, Ivana Cotrim, Lincoln Nunes, JÃºlio Cesar Leite: they are my group for the science fair and basically made everything else for the presentation;
- Keven Fongaro Fonseca, Lucas Quespaner: some friends of Mundo RPG Maker, a defuncted RPG Maker forum, that helped me with graphics and visuals;
- Probably some people in the internet that I use some free asset. Thanks, anon.
